# Ford-Credit-Coding-Exercises
This is where you can find my solution to the given Ford Credit Coding Exercise. I chose to solve the 
Manhattan Distance Problem, as I had never worked with it before. Essentially, you are able to come 
to a solution and get a value by taking the absolute value of the difference between the x-coordinates 
of the two points and adding that to the absolute value of the difference between the y-coordinates of 
the two points.
