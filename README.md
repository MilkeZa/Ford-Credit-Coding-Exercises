# Ford-Credit-Coding-Exercises
This is where you can find my solution to the given Ford Credit Coding Exercise. I chose to solve the 
Manhattan Distance Problem, as I had never worked with it before. Essentially, you are able to come 
to a solution and get a value by taking the absolute value of the difference between the x-coordinates 
of the two points and adding that to the absolute value of the difference between the y-coordinates of 
the two points.

### How to Run
Since this is basic python and doesn't contain any outside libraries, it should run out of the box
considering Macs have had Python pre-installed for years now. Should yours not have Python installed,
you can find instructions on how to install Python3 at: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once you're
done with the installation (or not in the case it was already on your system), you can choose to run it
inside your IDE of choice, or straight from the command line.
